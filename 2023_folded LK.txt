After the withdrawal of the license for the Leipzig Kings to participate in the 2023 season, the Competition Committee of the European League of Football has made a decision on the games played so far and also on outstanding ones. This was presented to the other franchises by Commissioner Patrick Esume and met with approval.

The results of the games played by the Leipzig Kings until the final exclusion at the Prague Lions (18:15), against the Panthers Wrocław (31:6) and the Fehérvár Enthroners (24:47), at the Vienna Vikings (14:47) and against Berlin Thunder (39:14) remain in the valuation as well as the second comparison with the Prague Lions (35:0), which was cancelled at short notice.

In addition, the return games will be counted with the same result as the first games. An exception is the duel with the Fehérvár Enthroners, here the result is turned in favor of the Fehérvár Enthroners (24:47). In addition, the Cologne Centurions, whose games against Leipzig could not be played, will be credited with two wins. To achieve a balanced point difference, both games will be scored with 16:16. This corresponds to the average points scored by the Cologne Centurions.

"It was very important to us to find the fairest solution possible for all franchises. The Competition Committee's decision was based on a forecast of several scenarios for the remainder of the season and, based on the statistics, proved to be the most reasonable scenario. It may sound complicated, but our goal was to measure the teams' playoff chances as close as possible to how the games would have turned out," assures Patrick Esume, Commissioner of the European League of Football.
