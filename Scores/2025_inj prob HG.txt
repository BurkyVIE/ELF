Mercenaries at Nordic Storm officially recorded as 35:0 for Nordic Storm

The European League of Football matchup between Helvetic Mercenaries and Nordic Storm from Game Week 7 will not be rescheduled and has officially been recorded as 35:0 victory in favor of Nordic Storm.

In recent weeks the league and both teams made extensive efforts to identify a feasible alternative date. The only viable option that emerged was during the Bye Week in Week 12 (July 28 - August 3). But due to limited stadium availability and the upcoming international break, a rescheduling of the game was not possible.

Originally the game was postponed due to significant injury problems within the Swiss franchise's roster. In accordance with League Rules Section A 6ยง 5, the game will now be officially ruled as a 35:0 win for Nordic Storm due to forfeiture by the Helvetic Mercenaries.

Nordic Storm's season record is now 9-0, the Mercenaries go to 0-9.

The Nordic Storm clinch the North Division title and already secure a playoff spot.
